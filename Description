The attendance system is designed for faculty members of an institute and includes a login form for user verification. Once logged in, faculty can select a session to view and choose from their courses. Upon selecting a course, the application displays the course details and a list of enrolled students, each with a checkbox to mark attendance. Checking or unchecking the box marks students as present or absent, respectively, and updates the database in real-time without needing a save button. The system also features a datetime picker for changing attendance dates and allows faculty to download attendance reports as CSV files.
